# Stats-Preview-Card---Attempt-1
First try at a frontend mentor challenge

First challenge or attempt at doing anything straight from design on my own, struggled to figure something out for a couple days, till decided instead of just watching a tutorial I would try to read another solutions code to understand the structure he used and try to make mine similarly.
  First attempt was done with mainly grid, but alignment, boxes, background colors were all over the place
  Tried again grid from scratch
  Till finally tried grid and flex after watching some more flex and grid tutorials to refresh what I took on the HTML & CSS course on udemy

Although in the end i got something that looked similar to the challenge design, I just have a feeling that this could have been structure, aligned and styles so much better. Really felt like a total newbie at this (which I know I am, but ill get there).

Great experience overall, helped me also get just a little more comfortable starting using git and deploying to netlify, and helped consolidate my knowledge I gained attempting to figure something out without direct hand holding tutorial

Q- Things I want to figure out, is using flex to align the card in the center of the site the most optimal way to do it? If not what other way(s) are most optimal?

Q- I struggled to figure out how to recreate the violet overlay on the image, so tried some different methods online on stack overflow and such, but just didnt work couldnt figure    it out, what other methods are there of overlaying color on image?
        Ended up using similar method to another solution I read the code of!
        
Q- How better could I make it responsive, more info right below?

    Maybe its because of the way I structured it, would like help how to get it responsive on smaller mobile devices, seems to work responsively till about the width of the image,     tried a bit on this but just broke things, so i cleaned up code where it worked till the about 450px, even then doesnt look the cleanest

Q- Extra, hard being this new, because I feel like I dont know what I dont know, if you can get what I mean. If you have anymore feedback, advice, or resource to learn, let me know and thank you.


If you read all that, thank you!! And if you have any advice you could add an extra thank you, will do some more learning and try my next challenge soon or most likely retry this one again!

Theres probably some typos in this lol
